For Gorilla Disttribution Center's Payroll System, the website begins with a dropdown/loadng page where either the client or the admin can sign in. A client is not able to sign up if the admin didn't create a profile for you. It is only when the admin creates a profile and gives the client an employee ID, then the client is able to create an account.

### Client Side 


#### Sign Up

This is where users can sign up to create an account. However, before signing up, they must have access to an Employee ID provided by their HR Manager. When Admin-level access creates a profile for you, they will provide you with a UNIQUE Employee ID. Once you have an Employee ID, you can register your account. When signing up, you will have to provide your:
1. Employee ID
2. Username
3. Password
4. Email
5. Phone
6. Address
7. City
8. State
9. ZipCode

If you have already created an account with that username, email, or phone number, then it will not allow you to create a new account. You would have to talk to your HR Manager. Once you have successfully registered your account, you can sign in.

[Link to sign up Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/signup.php)

#### Sign In
Once your account has been created you can access your account by putting your Username and Password. When the Admin created your profile, they also gave you a Role that determines what type of access you have. If you have Role 1, then you will have client access. If your Role is 0, then it will be Admin access. The functionality and features available to you will depend on your role.

Once you successfully log in, it will take you to your appropriate dashboard.

#### Home Page
This page gives clients individual access to their Income Overiew, Announcemnt within the company, Upcoming Payday and their Payment Account.

[Link to access Home Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/clienthome.php)

#### Attendance
This page allows clients to input their employee ID, the time they clock in and the time they clock out, the total hours worked, and if any overtime is applied.

[Link to access Attendance Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/client_attandance.php)

#### Payroll
The payroll page allows clients to see their period start date and end date, and allows clients to see their gross income and their net income. The page also allows clients to add new payroll accordingly.

[Link to access Payroll Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/client_payroll.php)

#### Deduction and Benefits
This page allows clients to access different deductions e.g. different taxes and the percentage that is applied to that dectuction. This page also allows clients to view their benefits and the description of said benefits.


[Link to access Deduction and Benefits Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/client_deductions.php)

### Admin Side
The admin would have all of the access the clients have but instead of individually, the admin would be able to view all of the clients and make changes for different clients(Attendace, Payroll, Deduction and Benefit List).

[Link to admin deduction and benefit Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/deductionb.php)


In addition the admin would have exclusive access to the employee list and the different department.
