For Gorilla Disttribution Center's Payroll System, the website begins with a dropdown/loadng page where either the client or the admin can sign in. If either doesn't have an account it would allow for them to create an account and then allow them to sign in.

### Client Side 

#### Home Page
This page gives clients individual access to their Income Overiew, Announcemnt within the company, Upcoming Payday and their Payment Account.

[Link to access Home Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/clienthome.php)

#### Attendance
This page allows clients to input their employee ID, the time they clock in and the time they clock out, the total hours worked, and if any overtime is applied.

[Link to access Attendance Page](https://swe.umbc.edu/~nsubba1/prototypev6/PayrollSystem/client_attandance.php)

#### Payroll
The payroll page allows clients to see their period start date and end date, and allows clients to see their gross income and their net income. The page also allows clients to add new payroll accordingly.

#### Deduction and Benefits
This page allows clients to access different deductions e.g. different taxes and the percentage that is applied to that dectuction. This page also allows clients to view their benefits and the description of said benefits.

### Admin Side
The admin would have all of the access the clients have but instead of individually, the admin would be able to view all of the clients and make changes for different clients(Attendace, Payroll, Deduction and Benefit List).

In addition the admin would have exclusive access to the employee list and the different department.
